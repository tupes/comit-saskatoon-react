Learning Web Design Chapter 2: How the Web Works


## Introduction to HTML

**Readings**  
Learning Web Design Chapter 4: Creating a Simple Page 
- You can skip the "Launch a Text Editor" section, because we've already learned how to create files in VS Code.
- Keep in mind that the goal of this chapter is not to teach you the `<h1>` or `<img>` elements. These are just useful examples to explain the basics of HTML documents, elements, and attributes. Focus on the "big picture", not the specifics.
- Don't worry too much about Step 5 (CSS). We won't be talking about CSS for awhile, so just use this section to see what CSS looks like.
  
  
## Text

**Readings**  
Learning Web Design Chapter 5: Marking up Text
- Don't worry too much about the "More Content Elements" section. These elements are used much less often.
- Don't worry too much about the "Organizing Page Content" section. These elements can often confuse people, and they're completely optional.
- For the "Inline Element Roundup" section, don't worry about learning all of these elements. The important thing is to be aware of what kind of things are available.
- The "Improving Accessibility with Aria" section is important, but don't worry about learning it for now.

**Assessment**  
[Hogwarts lists](https://github.com/tupes/comit-react/blob/master/HTML/lists/lists-assessment.md)  
This is just about lists. The assessment in the "Links" section covers a lot of the text elements.

## Images

**Readings**  
Learning Web Design Chapter 7: Adding Images
- Don't worry about the "Adding SVG Images" section.

## Tables
**Readings**

**Assessment**  
[Planetary data table](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Tables/Structuring_planet_data)  
Because it involves CSS, don't worry about completing Step 7: "Add a black border just around the column that contains all the planet name row headers."

**Applications**  
- Issue Tracking Application
  - table of issues
- Email Client Application
  - Inbox table of emails
