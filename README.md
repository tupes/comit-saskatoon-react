# ComIT React Course, Saskatoon 2020 

## Expectations
Three months isn't a lot of time to learn web development and React from scratch, so things will move quickly. During class, I'll be stopping to ask if everyone is understanding the lesson so far, and to see if anyone has any questions. Please use these opportunities whenever you need to! Since you're all assumed to be brand-new at this, there aren't any bad questions in this course. Outside of class, please utilize our Slack channel for getting help.

I'll be providing readings and assignments here. I won't be checking if you completed the reading, but you'll only be making things more difficult for yourself if you don't. The assignments are for you to test your understanding and skills, so you won't be submitting them, but this is the best way for you to really learn the material.

The most important skills to develop are problem-solving and self-learning. I'm happy to provide help for anyone who needs it, but it's important to try different things, experiment, and use the internet as a resource. There's nothing I know that you can't find on the internet!
